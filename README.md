# üöõ 3D Cargo Loader - Smart Visualization & Interactivity (Unity3D)

This Unity3D project presents a **3D interactive visualization** system for smart cargo loading, originally developed as part of a research internship under **IIT Bombay's Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)** department. It focuses on **constraint-aware packing**, **real-time interactivity**, and **modular UI components**, laying the groundwork for future integration with **LLM-based optimization and user-guided loading tools**.

---

## üîç Overview

Manual cargo planning often lacks visual feedback, optimization flexibility, and adaptability to complex constraints like:
- Fragility
- Weight balancing
- Volume utilization
- Human decision support

This 3D module solves that by enabling:
- **Interactive placement** of cargo boxes inside a truck/container
- **UI-driven scenario simulation**
- **Constraint-aware packing visualizations**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üß± **Realistic 3D Loader Environment**
  - Accurate box placement inside container space
  - Ground plane and cargo collision handling

- üß© **Custom UI Panels**
  - Box creation interface (size, weight, type)
  - Real-time cargo list display
  - Constraint toggles (e.g., stacking limits, spacing)

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Interactive Manipulation**
  - Add/move/delete cargo in 3D view
  - Mouse-based drag + keyboard controls
  - Snap-to-grid for clean packing alignment

- üì¶ **Predefined and Dynamic Packing Modes**
  - Demonstrates sample packing logic
  - Ready to extend for automated LLM-guided decisions
